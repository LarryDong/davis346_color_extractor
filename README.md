# davis346_color_extractor
A demo for extracting (and drawing) color events from a DAVIS346-color.

// figure

This demo includes a `.csv` file recorded from DV-software, capturing a "RGB" characters in screen with black background.

Since the color does not appear a "standard" RGB color in camera, "R" would generate green/blue events.  
Thus, a event-intensity image is show to verify the "R" generate more red events than "G" and "B".


## Usage
```bash
python extractor.py 
    --filename=davis_color.csv
    --events_number=3e4
```
**Parameters**
@filename: input davis346 csv file, recorded by DV-software or other drivers.
@events_number: how many events to draw for each event frame


## About DAVIS346 color
Davis346-color uses a 2x2 RGBG Bayer pattern,   
which means 'red events' in even-row/even-col (index from 0), 'blue events' in odd-row/odd-col, 'green events' in both even-row/odd-col and odd-row/event-col.
